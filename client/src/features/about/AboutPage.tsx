              Peg (this Pug on my lap) was the inspiration for this work, she
              keeps me company during the fun hours I spend studying and
              improving my knowledge, this project is just a demonstration for
              future partners and those interested in my work.
              <p>
                I'm a programmer passionate about technology. My experience as a
                developer started in 2006 at the biggest private bank in Brazil,
                working in the automation of processes in the Credit Card
                operation, in the last 6 years, I have been working on
                modernization and website maintenance projects at Mercer Human
                Resource Consulting on Private Pension Fund Management Business.
                My work is not a source of income, it is a source of life! My
                motivation is knowing that with my work I can make people's
                daily lives better, focusing on the customer and continuous
                improvement! I have passion for my work and a lot of willingness
                to share knowledge, which is the best way to acquire more! I am
                looking for opportunities to advance my career and develop my
                skills.
